## What We Did

During this week, we were able to implement some core mechanics such as moving, shooting, as well as enemy AI and health. While the image displayed is not the best, the circle represents the player, the capsules represent the enemies following the player, and the square is the projectile that the player shoots out by clicking. In the following weeks, we plan to replace these objects with sprites as well as adding our core mechanic of melee to combat the enemies. We also plan to implent our UI as well as creating more rooms for our first level.
