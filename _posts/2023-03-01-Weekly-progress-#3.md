## What We Did

During this week, we were able to implement some different enemy shot patterns. For example, the enemy can now shoot bullets in all directions, or shoot bullets in a forked pattern. This involves using a few scripts to put objects within a pool to shoot from. As such, it is a more efficient way of spawning in bullet prefabs and despawning them. We also reworked some player movement scripts to make them more efficient. Lastly, we also updated the map so we have a finished first level prototype.
