## What We Did

This week, we implemented more character interactions as well as updating our map to have functional hitboxes. For example, our map now has obstacles and walls that interact with the player as well as enemies. The player scripts have also been slightly more optimized as well as implementing our main feature, melee. Melee attacks at the moment, do not have an animation to show attacks but function in terms of damaging the enemy. They also have a dash button that has a cooldown. We were also experimenting with different camera settings in order to figure out the best camera movement for our game.
