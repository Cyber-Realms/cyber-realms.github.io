## What We Did

For this week, we thought of ways of implementing spawning methods for our enemies. We decided on spawning the enemies when the player gets teleported into the room. The doors would lock and the player would not be able to leave the room until clearing out the room. We also created a main menu for the game as well as a pause menu. Currently, the player is able to hit start to play the game and press quit to close the application. The pause menu has three buttons, resume, back to menu, and quit. Resume will resume the game. Pressing back to menu will return back to main menu, removing any progress made, and quitting will close the application.
