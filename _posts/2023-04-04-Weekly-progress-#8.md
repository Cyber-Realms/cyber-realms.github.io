## What We Did

For this week, we really wanted to focus more on making more levels as interesting shot patterns that enemies can do. While programming the shot patterns, things such as a helix shot type where it was a continuous stream of projectiles was one of the ones we wanted to implement. However, doing so was proving to be a very difficult task. We decided to settle on a stream of projectiles shooting in a sin wave pattern and on top of that, we added the ability for the shot angles to be random. The map and level design was something else we wanted on as only having one level didn't feel complete enough. Not only that, but it was a good time to fix some of the bugs we discovered when classmates were testing our first prototype of the game.
