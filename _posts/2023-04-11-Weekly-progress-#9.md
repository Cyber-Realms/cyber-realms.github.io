## What We Did

In this week, polishing up the game was one of our top priorities as some of the interactions did not work due to various bugs. We had some issues with the map collisions as well as our teleporting system for rooms. The door system was another thing that we wanted to touch up on because opening and closing the doors was not working as intended. We managed to fix up our doors by opening all of them once a player clears the room they are in. All doors will then close when they enter the next room. The map collisions were also all fixed so that the player sprite is now able to move around.
