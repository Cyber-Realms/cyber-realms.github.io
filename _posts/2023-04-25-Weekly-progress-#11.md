## What We Did

At this point in time, we are nearly finished with our game. For the final touches, we wanted to add in our sounds as well as the final random spawns for our levels. We added sounds for various actions such as walking, shooting, and taking damage. The final test for us was to make sure that our random spawning worked with our door system. As soon as a player enters a room, the spawner will randomly spawn enemies inside of the room. This will only work in the room the player is in.
